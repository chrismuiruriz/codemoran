                    <p>It is critical you understand what you agree to when you create an account on Kava. Kava highlights four major points you must agree to use its services:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>By virtue of registering on Kava and making a deposit, you become a unit holder in the Britam Money Market Fund and your registration for, use and continuous usage of the Service shall be deemed as acceptance of the terms.</li>
                        <li>Kava services will be provided to you as long as you are the sole account holder of your Kava and Britam Money Market Fund account or have the mandate to singularly operate the specified account. </li>
                        <li>When you borrow against your savings, a lien equivalent to the money borrowed plus fees will be placed on your savings, which means you will have no access to that amount until all outstanding amounts are repaid in full.</li>
                        <li>In the unfortunate circumstance that you fail to repay your loan and your account falls into default, Kava will recover the outstanding amount from your savings and investment.</li>
